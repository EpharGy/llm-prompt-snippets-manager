2. **‚úÖ COMPLETED: Robust backend integration**
   - MetadataManager with validation/auto-creation
   - DataManager with proper GUI format loading
   - Snippet class with clean category_id/label_ids
3. **‚úÖ COMPLETED: Professional GUI with smart state management**
   - Unified refresh system preserving selections/filters
   - Filter bubble updates after metadata changes
   - Clean prompt preview/copy functionality
4. **‚úÖ COMPLETED: Comprehensive logging system**
   - Structured, emoji-rich logging throughout
   - User-facing and debug-level messages
   - Replaced all print statements with proper logging
5. **‚úÖ COMPLETED: Maintainable codebase**
   - Documented reusable functions and patterns
   - Smart state preservation patterns
   - Professional error handling and user feedback

   - [ ] Fix any user-reported issues from initial release
   - [ ] Handle edge cases in data validation
   - [ ] Improve error messaging and user feedback
   - [ ] Validate all UI interactions work correctly

5. **Technical Debt & Code Quality**
   - [ ] **Debug Mode Launch** - Update debug mode to launch via `debug.py` instead of environment variable
   - [ ] **Print Statement Cleanup** - Replace remaining print() calls with proper logging
   - [ ] **Centralized Styling** - Move hardcoded UI colors/styles to theme system
   - [ ] **Complex Filter Logic** - Break down `_apply_bubble_filters()` into smaller functions
   - [ ] **Scroll Wheel Handling** - Replace manual widget tree traversal with proper event delegation
   - [ ] **Consistent Error Handling** - Standardize error handling patterns (bool returns vs exceptions)
